        "heading": "What ‘Image to Pixel Art’ Means",
        "body": "Image to pixel art describes the process of translating a regular photo or illustration into crisp, blocky pixels that look like classic 8‑bit or 16‑bit graphics. Instead of simply blurring detail, image to pixel art intentionally preserves hard edges and square facets so shapes read clearly at a low resolution. With our browser tool, image to pixel art runs 100% locally: you upload or choose a sample, tweak pixel size, and see results instantly. Because image to pixel art happens entirely on your device, there’s no waiting for servers, no watermarks, and no sign‑ups. You get a fast creative loop: try different pixel sizes, compare outcomes in seconds, and download a small or original‑size result when you’re happy."

        "heading": "Why Choose This Image to Pixel Art Tool",
        "body": "We built this image to pixel art experience to be simple, private, and effective for everyday creators. First, everything is client‑side: image to pixel art never leaves your browser, which protects your privacy and reduces latency. Second, the interface is direct: upload, adjust, download—no clutter. Third, the preview is instant, so image to pixel art decisions are visual, not guesswork. Finally, downloads are flexible: export a compact pixel canvas for avatars, or upscale to the original dimensions to keep those chunky, hard‑edged pixels for posters, presentations, or print."

        "heading": "How to Use the Image to Pixel Art Converter",
        "body": "Step 1 — Upload an image or start with the sample. The image to pixel art preview appears immediately. Step 2 — Drag the slider to set pixel size. Larger pixels push the image to pixel art look toward bold, retro blocks; smaller pixels keep more detail while staying stylized. Step 3 — Download your favorite version. Choose the quick small download, or pick the original‑size option to scale the image to pixel art result back up without softening edges. In every step you’ll see the change in real time, which makes the image to pixel art process approachable even if you’ve never used design software."

        "heading": "Pixel Art vs. Pixelation: The Key Difference",
        "body": "People sometimes confuse image to pixel art with privacy pixelation. Pixelation is a censorship blur—its goal is to hide information. By contrast, image to pixel art is an aesthetic choice: it uses low resolution and hard‑edged blocks to stylize content while keeping shapes readable. Our approach uses smoothing‑off scaling so edges stay crisp and the image to pixel art result feels intentional, not simply degraded. If your aim is retro style, icons, sprites, or posters, image to pixel art is the right path; if you need to obscure faces or data, a different ‘pixelate image’ tool is better."

        "heading": "Who Benefits from Image to Pixel Art",
        "body": "• Indie developers and game artists: turn sketches or references from image to pixel art to test UI icons, sprites, or level comps. • Social creators and marketers: make avatars, story covers, or thumbnails with an eye‑catching image to pixel art vibe in minutes. • Teachers and workshop leaders: demonstrate sampling and resolution using image to pixel art as a hands‑on visual. • Makers and print‑at‑home fans: export grids for cross‑stitch, perler beads, and sticker designs; image to pixel art helps count blocks and define color areas."

        "heading": "Tips to Get Better Image to Pixel Art Results",
        "body": "Start large, then refine: push pixels bigger to establish bold shapes, then lower the slider until the image to pixel art balance feels right. Favor contrast: high‑contrast photos with clear subjects translate to cleaner image to pixel art blocks. Simplify composition: centered subjects and minimal backgrounds let image to pixel art read clearly at a glance. Export both sizes: use the small download for profiles, and the original‑size image to pixel art for banners or print so the pixel edges stay crisp."

      {
        "heading": "Privacy, Speed, and Reliability",
        "body": "Every image to pixel art conversion happens in your browser tab. There are no uploads, no external processing steps, and no waiting for queues. That makes image to pixel art faster for quick experiments and safer for sensitive images. Because the workflow is lightweight, mobile and desktop users can try multiple image to pixel art variations without hitting a paywall or sign‑in screen."

      {
        "heading": "Advanced Controls Many Creators Want",
        "body": "Beyond pixel size, creators often request palette limits and dithering to make image to pixel art results feel closer to specific consoles or classic microcomputers. Common requests include fixed color counts, retro palettes like Game Boy, NES, or PICO‑8, optional error‑diffusion dithering, and visible grid overlays. While this release focuses on a streamlined flow, we designed the image to pixel art experience to grow toward these creative controls without sacrificing speed."

      {
        "heading": "A Simple Workflow That Scales",
        "body": "Use the tool to sketch direction quickly: run a fast image to pixel art pass in the browser, save your favorite, and then bring it into your layout or editing app for text, borders, or background color. If a project evolves, repeat the image to pixel art step with alternate crops, lighting, or color tweaks. This loop keeps the core image to pixel art style consistent while you iterate on content."

    },
    {
      "q": "Which download should I choose—small or original‑size?",
      "a": "Small is perfect for avatars and quick posts. Original‑size preserves the hard edges of image to pixel art when you need banners, slides, or print."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I pick the best pixel size?",
      "a": "There isn’t one universal answer. Start large to see bold forms, then lower the slider until your image to pixel art looks readable and stylish."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is this different from simple pixelation?",
      "a": "Yes. Pixelation hides detail for privacy. Image to pixel art is an aesthetic transformation that keeps edges crisp and improves low‑res readability."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use the results commercially?",
      "a": "Usage depends on your rights to the source image. The tool adds no watermark, and your image to pixel art download is yours to use within those rights."
    },
    {
      "q": "What images work best?",
      "a": "Subjects with clean silhouettes and strong contrast usually create the clearest image to pixel art outcomes, especially for avatars or icons."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is this so fast?",
      "a": "There are no network trips. The image to pixel art rendering happens locally, so previews feel instant and downloads are immediate."
